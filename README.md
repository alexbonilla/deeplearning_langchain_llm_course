# DeepLearning.ai course: Langchain for LLM Application Development

This is the work course, available for free at https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/. 

While following locally the examples in the Jupyter Notebooks, I realized they used datasets that are not provided. So I added two datasets from kaggle.com and adapted the examples to perform the llm operations over them:

1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog

In order to work locally with these notebooks, you will need to setup your own Open API Key. 
You can follow these instructions:

1. https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key to obtain your API Key.
2. https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety for best practices using your API Key. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Happy learning!
