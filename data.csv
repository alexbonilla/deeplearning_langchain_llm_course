Product;Review
"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)";I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)";This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)";Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark
"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)";I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.
