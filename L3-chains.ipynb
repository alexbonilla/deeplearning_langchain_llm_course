We understand the importance of affordability, portability, and durability, and we are glad that the Kindle meets your expectations in these areas.\\n\\nIt's fantastic that the Kindle helps prevent your one-year-old from tearing pages. We designed it with durability in mind to withstand even the most curious little hands. We hope it continues to be a great solution for you and your child.\\n\\nRegarding the lack of backlight, we appreciate your resourcefulness in finding a solution by using a book light. While the Kindle does not have a built-in backlight, the addition of a book light is indeed a great way to enjoy your reading in low-light conditions. We'll make sure to pass on your feedback regarding this feature to our team for future consideration.\\n\\nThank you once again for your positive feedback and for choosing the Kindle. If you have any further questions or require any assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy reading!\"}"

As the temperature increases, the peak intensity of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, resulting in a change in color from red to orange, yellow, white, and eventually blue at very high temperatures.\\n\\nBlack body radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and has significant applications in various fields, including astrophysics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. It played a crucial role in the development of quantum theory and understanding the behavior of light and matter.'"
